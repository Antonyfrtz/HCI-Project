# HCI-Project
A hotel management app made for Human-Computer Interaction class in WPF using XAML, C# and HTML-JS

You can login as user (any credentials will do) or admin (use admin as username with empty password on login)

For the user app to be used properly (Navigation UI), please replace the API keys in html/mapview and html/map_route with your own (the existing key is deprecated)
A key can be generated by using the following instructions 

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.
2. If you have not already done so, create a project by clicking on the project dropdown menu in the top left corner of the console and selecting "New Project". Follow the prompts to create a new project.
3. Once you have created your project, select it from the project dropdown menu.
4. In the sidebar, click on "APIs & Services" and then click on "Credentials".
5. Find the Create Credentials option, and select 'API Key'.

There is a generous free quota for Google Maps so you shouldn't worry about billing :)
